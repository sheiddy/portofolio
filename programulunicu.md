# ProgramuLuNicu
Does a bunch of stuff suited for me, or stuff that I need/liked to build.

* Crypto Tab
  *  Periodically fetches crypto prices (BTC + ETH only atm) and displays them on separate user control. Pic is for demo only with random values (API limitations).

 * Tarkov
  *  Helpers for tarkov. For example, showing scavs and bosses HP on each  body part, showing various stats from selected scav.

* ESP Tab
  * Interface for a ESP to connect to.
  * Depending on implementation, it can do one of the following:
    * Take data and events trough a ESP8266 D1 Mini from a PIR sensor and send notification to server (=PC running this program) and also plots the temp. Example:

    * Take data and events trough a ESP8266 D1 Mini from various greenhouse sensors (soil humidity, temperature, light). Still under development.


    * For the ESP D1 with a mini OLED display, use this configuration:

* WW3 Tab
  * Will scrap the oryx website for all the lost equipment, for both the Ukraine and Russian side.
  * Takes data, parses it and uploads it to  ftp://win6042.site4now.net/lost_equipment_russia.html and ftp://win6042.site4now.net/lost_equipment_ukraine.html
  * Shows parsed and manipulated data to the WW3 tab and split onto those 2 countries. The update buttons will update the database with the latest losses from oryx.

* ML Stuff development is paused ATM. Last time it was using quite a bit of CPU (this is not the reason for development pause tho).
