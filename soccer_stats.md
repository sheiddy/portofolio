# Soccer_Stats_Retrieval

Gets all matches from soccerstats.com for the selected day that have not yet started. 
For each match found, it parses a set of data and passes them trough a self-made algorithm that returns matches that are worth betting on. 
Optionally, the "Parse Odds", when enabled, will search for those matches on flashscore.com and return their respective odds.

The website has been discontinued due to me a combination of me losing interest in sports betting, the introduction of cookies and other.
